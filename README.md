## Development Environment
This will give a (hopefully) complete guide to setting up this repo for development.
1. Setup NodeJs, recommended to use NVM to do so
2. Clone the repo and run either `yarn` or `npm install`, depending if you had yarn on your machine
3. Run `react-native link` to link the plugins
4. Follow the instructions from React Native to be able to run on your phone/in browser: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
