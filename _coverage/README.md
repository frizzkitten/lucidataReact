# Coverage
Saving these reports for the Iteration 2 code coverage improvements guidelines.  
Each report directory will be labeled with the commit hash it was ran on.  
*Note: this process is normally automated, but Coveralls did not have an obvious option for 
usage with React-Native and Jest. This may get updated in the future, but the project time is
better spent on the code than getting a fun badge on the repo.*
